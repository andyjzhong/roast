# Roast Tab

## Journal

### Day 1

#### Set Up
- Build initial files and connect HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Add CSS libraries: Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

#### HTML & CSS
- Add a navbar and a sample button with an event listener that logs text in the console when clicked.
- Build initial HTML layout with 3 main sections: tab-area, menu-area, and total-section.
- Create a table for menu items to be added to every time a menu item is selected.
- Very minor styling, enough to help identify div sizes.

#### JavaScript
- Expand on button event handler to append a new table row to the tab area with the name of the food item.
- Loop through array of selected food items, grab the price, and reduce it to a total bill price.
- Add a Cancel Order button and Send Order button.
- Add a modal when Pay button is clicked to bring up the payment screen.

#### Other
- Examine Postman output and create a sample data set so that I'm not making too many expensive API calls during initial build.
- Create initial ReadMe file to keep track of progress each day.
