# Roast Tab

## Journal

### Day 1
- Build initial files and connect HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Add CSS libraries: Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
- Examine Postman output and create a sample data set so that I'm not making too many expensive API calls during initial build.
- Add a navbar and a sample button with an event listener that logs text in the console when clicked.
- Build initial HTML layout with 3 main sections: tab-area, menu-area, and total-section.
- Create initial ReadMe file to keep track of progress each day.
- Very minor styling, enough to help identify div sizes.
